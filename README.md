All scripts listed here are **NOT interoperable** and are meant for **PERSONAL use ONLY**. 

Though, I will continually improve my scripts so that they become more interoperable, efficient and better at error handling.


## SCRIPT DESCRIPTION
1. Monset: Used to handle changing my net card's mode from managed to monitor and vice-versa.
